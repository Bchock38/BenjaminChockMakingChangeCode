|:-----------|:-----------:|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------:|
| April 5    |   9-10pm    |                                                                                                                           I tried to write abstract, efficient code. |
| January 27 |   9-9:55    |                                   Brainstormed different ways to solve making change. Tried to use modules to solve, but it didn't work to many outside way to solve |
| January 28 |  2 - 2:30   |                                                                                                                         Started doing new attempt different solution |
| Feb 1st    |    9-10     | Thought about how to approach new solutions contniued to code it. Consufused my self a bit on how to do smaller umber by number but think I've thought of a good way |
| Feb 10     | 12:50 -1:20 |                                                                                                          finished my first solution for memoazation but doesn't work |
| Feb 12     |   9- 9:12   |                          fixed the first solution for memoization. forget to add if target is 0 return 1, so it had nothing to add/build up from now passes all test |
