| January 27 |  9-9:55  |                                   Brainstormed different ways to solve making change. Tried to use modules to solve, but it didn't work to many outside way to solve |

| Feb 1st    |   9-10    | Thought about how to approach new solutions contniued to code it. Consufused my self a bit on how to do smaller umber by number but think I've thought of a good way |
