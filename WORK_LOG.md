| January 28 |  2 - 2:30   |                                                                                                                                       Started doing new attempt different solution |
| Feb 1st   |    9-10     |               Thought about how to approach new solutions contniued to code it. Consufused my self a bit on how to do smaller umber by number but think I've thought of a good way |
| Feb 10    | 12:50 -1:20 |                                                                                                                        finished my first solution for memoazation but doesn't work |
| Feb 12    |   9- 9:30   | fixed the first solution for memoization. forget to add if target is 0 return 1, so it had nothing to add/build up from now passes all test. started making my tabulation solution |
| Feb 13    |  10:-10:08  |                                             finished my first attempt at tab. forgot to get index of coins.length-1 instaed of coins.length. fixed that and then passed all 6 test |
